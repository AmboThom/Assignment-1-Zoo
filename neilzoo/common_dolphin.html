    <h4><em>
        The common dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a 
        global population of about six million. Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the 
        common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging 
        to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, 
        the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most 
        notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization. (Source: Wikipedia)
