    <h4><em>
        The bonobo is an endangered great ape. It is one of the two species making up the genus Pan, 
        the other being the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The bonobo is distinguished by relatively 
        long legs, pink lips, dark face, tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. 
        The bonobo is found in a 500,000 km2 (190,000 sq mi) area of the Congo Basin in the Democratic 
        Republic of the Congo, Central Africa. The species is frugivorous and inhabits primary and 
        secondary forests, including seasonally inundated swamp forests. (Source: Wikipedia)
