    <h4><em>
        Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda, 
        branching from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago. Mantis 
        shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm 
        (15 in). These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time 
        hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely 
        exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, 
        or crepuscular (active at twilight), depending on the species. (Source: Wikipedia)
