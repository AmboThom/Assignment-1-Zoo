                Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth. A giraffe's neck can be 6ft and weighs about 600 pounds. 
                They don't need sleep for very long because giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour 
                period! They often take quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time and can even rest while 
                standing. Many people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of sounds, including 
                moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just very rarely do so. <br>
                
                Adult male giraffes establish dominance hierarchies by sparring. Where the males march in step with one 
                another. They rub and intertwine their necks and heads, then lean against each other to evaluate their 
                opponent's strength. There's also "necking" when two giraffes stand alongside each other and swing their 
                heads at the other giraffe. They aim their horns at their opponent's rump, flanks, or neck. A hard enough 
                blow can knock down or injure an opponent.
